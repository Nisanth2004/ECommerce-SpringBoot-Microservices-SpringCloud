As a business owner in the e-commerce sector, I am currently operating without the support of digital solutions. My product line includes a variety of items, each with a unique code and detailed description.

Customers interact with my business by placing orders from this product list. I identify my customers using their first name, last name, email, and address. Each transaction involves a specific payment method. Upon successful payment, I inform the customer via email, confirming the transaction or notifying them of any payment failures.

To streamline operations and promote growth, I am looking to invest in the development of a dedicated application. This application will simplify business processes, enhance overall efficiency, and significantly contribute to the scalability of my online venture.
